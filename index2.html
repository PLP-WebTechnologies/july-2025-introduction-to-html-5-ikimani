            <p>Welcome to my very first HTML5 web page! I’m on a mission to learn how to create clean, semantic, and accessible websites that are friendly for both humans and search engines.</p>

                I’m here to learn the real stuff — not just memorizing tags, but actually understanding how HTML5 works so I can build web pages that make sense to humans and search engines. I want my sites to be friendly for <em>everyone</em> to use, even if they’re on a screen reader. My big dream? To become a full-stack software developer who can code something cool from scratch, whether it’s a portfolio, a dashboard, or the next big app. I’m also aiming to dive into digital forensics and cybersecurity later, because I love solving puzzles and catching digital “bad guys.” At the end of the day, I just want to keep learning, keep creating, and maybe one day look back at my first little HTML page and laugh at how far I’ve come.
